# GOOGLE_MAP_CLONE
Description:
The Google Clone project is an open-source endeavor hosted on GitHub that aims to recreate the core functionality and design of the popular search engine, Google. This project serves as a valuable learning resource for developers interested in web development, front-end design, and API integration. By dissecting and understanding the intricacies of building a search engine interface, users can gain insights into various technologies and best practices.

Key Features:

    Search Interface: The project replicates Google's iconic minimalist search bar, allowing users to enter search queries and experience real-time suggestions as they type.

    Search Results Page: The search results page closely mimics Google's layout, displaying relevant search results along with titles, descriptions, and URLs. Pagination and dynamic loading of results as the user scrolls are also implemented.

    Responsive Design: The project emphasizes responsive design principles, ensuring that the interface functions seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

    Live Suggestions: As users type in the search bar, live suggestions are generated using mock data, simulating the autocomplete feature that Google provides.
